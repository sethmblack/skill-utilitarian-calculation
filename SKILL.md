# Utilitarian Calculation

Apply Mill's Greatest Happiness Principle to evaluate actions, policies, or decisions by their tendency to promote happiness for all affected—counting each person equally while attending to the quality of outcomes, not merely their quantity.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What should we do?" or "What policy is best?"
- Facing a decision that affects multiple people
- Weighing competing interests or outcomes
- Evaluating the ethics of an action or policy
- Resolving conflicts between different goods
- Making trade-offs where someone will be affected negatively

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| action_or_policy | Yes | The choice, action, or policy being evaluated |
| alternatives | No | Other options being considered |
| affected_parties | No | Who will be impacted by the decision |
| constraints | No | Any limits on what can be considered |

## Mill's Greatest Happiness Principle

"The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure."

"The happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator."

"In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbor as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality."

## The Framework (7 Steps)

**Step 1: Identify the Options**

What are the possible actions, policies, or choices?
- List all realistic alternatives
- Include the option of doing nothing
- Be specific about what each option involves

**Step 2: Identify All Affected Parties**

Who will be impacted by each option?
- Direct stakeholders
- Indirect stakeholders
- Future generations (if relevant)
- Those who cannot speak for themselves

*Remember:* Each person's happiness counts as much as anyone else's. "Everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one."

**Step 3: Assess Consequences for Each Party**

For each option, analyze effects on each party:

| Party | Option A Effects | Option B Effects |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Party 1] | [+happiness/-unhappiness] | [+happiness/-unhappiness] |
| [Party 2] | [+happiness/-unhappiness] | [+happiness/-unhappiness] |

Consider:
- Intensity of pleasure or pain
- Duration of effects
- Certainty or probability
- Proximity (near-term vs. long-term)
- Extent (how many affected)

**Step 4: Apply Qualitative Assessment**

Not all pleasures are equal. Consider:
- Does this outcome engage higher or lower faculties?
- Would competent judges prefer this type of satisfaction?
- Is the happiness shallow and fleeting, or deep and enduring?

A smaller amount of higher-quality happiness may outweigh a larger amount of lower-quality pleasure.

**Step 5: Consider Secondary Effects**

What rules, habits, or expectations does this action create?
- Does it set a precedent that produces good or bad effects overall?
- Does it undermine trust, institutions, or social cooperation?
- Does it develop or degrade character?

Mill recognizes that individual actions are often best judged by rules that generally promote happiness, rather than calculating each case from scratch.

**Step 6: Check for Impartiality**

Am I counting everyone equally?
- Am I giving my own interests undue weight?
- Am I discounting the happiness of those unlike me?
- Would a "disinterested and benevolent spectator" reach the same conclusion?

**Step 7: Render Judgment**

Based on the analysis:
- Which option produces the greatest happiness for all affected?
- Which option best balances quality and quantity of outcomes?
- Which option creates the best precedents and secondary effects?

## Utilitarian Calculation

### The Decision
[What is being decided]

### The Options
1. [Option A]
2. [Option B]
3. [Option C / Status quo]

### Affected Parties
- [Party 1]: [Their stake in the outcome]
- [Party 2]: [Their stake in the outcome]
- [etc.]

### Consequence Analysis

#### Option A: [Name]

| Party | Effect | Intensity | Duration | Quality | Probability |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [Party 1] | [+/-] | [H/M/L] | [Short/Long] | [Higher/Lower] | [%] |
| [Party 2] | [+/-] | [H/M/L] | [Short/Long] | [Higher/Lower] | [%] |

**Net assessment:** [Summary of overall happiness produced/prevented]

#### Option B: [Name]
[Same structure]

### Qualitative Considerations
- **Higher pleasures involved:** [Which options engage intellectual, moral, aesthetic faculties?]
- **Character effects:** [Which options develop or degrade character?]
- **Competent judge preference:** [What would those who understand both options choose?]

### Secondary Effects
- **Precedent:** [What rules or expectations does this create?]
- **Trust/cooperation:** [Does this build or undermine social trust?]
- **Long-term patterns:** [What behavior does this encourage?]

### Impartiality Check
[Confirmation that all parties are weighted equally]

### Judgment

**Recommended action:** [Option X]

**Reasoning:** [Why this option produces the greatest happiness for all affected]

**The Principle Applied:**
"Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness."
```

## Qualitative Factors to Consider

| Factor | Higher Quality | Lower Quality |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Faculty engaged | Intellectual, moral, aesthetic | Merely sensory |
| Duration | Enduring satisfaction | Fleeting gratification |
| Development | Builds capacity for more | Leaves unchanged or degrades |
| Depth | Profound meaning | Shallow amusement |
| Social value | Benefits others too | Benefits self only |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Counting only immediate effects** - Consider long-term and secondary consequences
2. **Ignoring quality** - A smaller amount of higher pleasure may outweigh more of lower
3. **Privileging the visible** - Don't ignore those who can't advocate for themselves
4. **Discounting probabilities** - Unlikely but severe outcomes still matter
5. **Ignoring your own interests** - You count for one, but not for zero
6. **Rule-breaking for marginal gains** - Consider whether violating good rules undermines their general benefit

---

## Constraints

- Count each person's happiness equally
- Consider both quality and quantity of outcomes
- Include long-term and secondary effects
- Be honest about uncertainty and probabilities
- Recognize that some outcomes involve incommensurable goods
- When in doubt, prefer options that respect liberty (allowing future choices)

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our company is deciding whether to lay off 50 employees or reduce everyone's salary by 10%. What's the right choice?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Utilitarian Calculation

### The Decision
How to address a budget shortfall: layoffs versus across-the-board pay cuts.

### The Options
1. **Layoffs:** Terminate 50 employees (10% of workforce)
2. **Pay Cuts:** Reduce all salaries by 10%
3. **Hybrid:** Some layoffs and some cuts
4. **Status Quo:** Do nothing and risk company failure

### Affected Parties
- **500 current employees:** Their income, security, and well-being
- **50 employees targeted for layoff:** Severe impact on their lives
- **Families of all employees:** Dependents affected by income changes
- **Shareholders/owners:** Financial stake in company viability
- **Customers/community:** Depend on company's continued operation
- **Future employees:** Jobs that won't exist if company fails

### Consequence Analysis

#### Option 1: Layoffs (50 employees)

| Party | Effect | Intensity | Duration | Quality | Probability |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 50 laid off | Severe negative | High | Long | Affects all life dimensions | 100% |
| 450 remaining | Relief + survivor guilt | Medium | Medium | Mixed | 100% |
| Families of 50 | Severe hardship | High | Long | All dimensions | 100% |
| Company viability | Improved | Medium | Long | N/A | 80% |

**Net assessment:** Concentrates severe suffering on 50 individuals and their families. Company more likely to survive. Creates atmosphere of fear among remaining employees.

#### Option 2: Pay Cuts (10% across board)

| Party | Effect | Intensity | Duration | Quality | Probability |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| All 500 | Moderate negative | Low-Medium | Until restored | Financial only | 100% |
| All families | Moderate hardship | Low-Medium | Until restored | Financial only | 100% |
| Top performers | Frustration, may leave | Medium | Medium | Career/morale | 30% |
| Company viability | Improved | Medium | Long | N/A | 75% |

**Net assessment:** Distributes burden across many, reducing severity for any individual. No one faces catastrophic loss. Some risk of losing best employees who can find other jobs.

### Qualitative Considerations

**Higher pleasures involved:**
- Security and dignity in employment engage higher faculties
- Solidarity and shared sacrifice can be meaningful
- Layoff trauma affects psychological well-being deeply

**Character effects:**
- Layoffs teach survivors that loyalty isn't valued
- Shared sacrifice builds community and trust
- Both options force confrontation with difficult realities

**Competent judge preference:**
Those who have experienced both situations (and understand both) typically prefer the shared-burden approach. The security of knowing you won't be arbitrarily eliminated is worth the financial sacrifice.

### Secondary Effects

**Precedent:**
- Layoffs signal that individuals are expendable
- Pay cuts signal that the company shares burdens collectively

**Trust/cooperation:**
- Layoffs create fear and self-protection
- Shared cuts create solidarity (if perceived as fair)

**Long-term patterns:**
- Layoffs incentivize employees to prioritize escape routes
- Shared sacrifice incentivizes employees to help solve problems

### Impartiality Check

Am I giving equal weight to:
- The 50 who would be laid off? Yes—their suffering counts fully
- The executives who might also take cuts? Yes—10% of a high salary is still 10%
- Those with fewer options vs. more? Yes—the 50 include those least able to recover

### Judgment

**Recommended action:** Pay cuts (with modifications)

**Reasoning:**

The utilitarian calculus favors the pay cut option because:

1. **Distribution of harm:** 50 people facing severe harm (job loss) produces more total unhappiness than 500 people facing moderate harm (pay reduction). The intensity of unemployment—loss of income, identity, security, routine—is far greater than the inconvenience of a 10% cut.

2. **Quality of outcomes:** The psychological harm of unemployment engages deep aspects of well-being, not merely financial comfort. It affects sense of purpose, self-worth, and future outlook.

3. **Reversibility:** Pay cuts can be restored when conditions improve. Layoffs destroy relationships, skills, and lives in ways that cannot be easily undone.

4. **Secondary effects:** A company that shares burdens builds loyalty and cooperation. A company that discards workers creates a culture of self-protection.

**Modifications to consider:**
- Larger cuts at higher salary levels (progressive sharing)
- Commitment to restore salaries when conditions permit
- Clear communication about why this approach was chosen
- Genuine shared sacrifice including executives

**The Principle Applied:**
"The happiness which forms the utilitarian standard is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Stuart Mill** expert persona. Use it to make decisions that affect multiple parties by systematically considering the happiness of all. It pairs well with:
- **Higher Pleasures Assessment** for evaluating the quality of different outcomes
- **Harm Principle Analysis** for determining when intervention is justified
- **Liberty of Thought Defense** for cases involving freedom of expression
